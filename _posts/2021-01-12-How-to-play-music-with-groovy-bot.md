Hi, I'm alphaRomeo323.

My favorite Discord bot is **"[Groovy][official]"**.

TLDR: This is music bot.

## How to Listen to Youtube in Discord Voicechat

1. Copy link of YouTube video (Short URL `https://youtu.be` is fine.)
2. Invite Groovy bot from [here][official] to your server.
3. join Voicechat channel
4. type
   ```
   -p <copyed-url>
   ```

That's too EASY!!

The bot can play audio and video file on Internet. This is where I'm different from the other music bot's. ~~I don't know about that.~~

## How to Listen to Your Local Audio File

1. Invite Groovy bot from [here][official]
2. join Voicechat channel
3. Upload your local audio file (Be careful to copyrights of files.)
4. right click on audio file uploaded and select "Copy Link."

   ```
